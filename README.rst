Motivation
----------
I wrote this application to learn more about how trading can be automated by
doing simple technical analysis on charts. I stuck my nose into trading and
technical analysis in 2017.
I started to read book as trading in general and specialized myself on the
analysis part. As I am a professional programmer doing Python programming for
about 10 years it was natural to me to write such a program.
