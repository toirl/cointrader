Motivation
----------
This program exists because I want to learn more about automatic trading
based on a technical analysis of charts.
I am no expert on trading or crypto currencies! I am a professional
Python programmer who stuck his nose into the crypto coin and trading world in
2017 and who was directly fascinated on this topic. After reading some books
on technical analysis I decided to write this program to learn more about
how automatic trading works.
