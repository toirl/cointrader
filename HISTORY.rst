0.3.0 (not yet released)
------------------------
* Added backtest functionality. Cointrader can simulate trading in
  backtest mode. In this mode the trade is done on historic chart data. This
  is useful to check the performance of your trading strategy. Please note
  that the backtest is not 100% accurate as buy and sell prices are based on the
  closing price of the currency. This is idealistic and will not reflect the
  whole market situation.
